                                                                                                    <p>   A public insurance adjuster will be inspecting your home or business in preparation for filing a claim. They are hired by insurance companies to inspect properties insured by them to determine the full amount of damages so that the insurance company can settle the claim as quickly as possible. During these inspections, a public insurance adjuster will look for numerous factors to determine the value of your loss. This is part of the investigative process to determine the full amount of damages so that the insurance company can settle the claim as quickly as possible.   The following are some of the factors that a public insurance adjuster will look for during an inspection:-   Location - Where the property is located plays an important role in determining the value of the damage. If the home or business is located in a flood zone or an earthquake-prone area, the cost of repairs will be higher.- Insurance Company - What are the guidelines provided by your insurance carrier? - Do they have a “standard” for determining the value of your loss?- Size and Condition - The condition of the home or business is also important during an inspection. A homeowner’s insurance company will review the age, size and condition of the home to determine the amount of coverage.- Natural Hazards - Natural hazards, such as flooding or earthquakes, can have a significant impact on the value of your loss.- Type of Insurance - Depending on how your policy is written, your loss will be paid out a certain way. This will help the adjuster determine the value of your loss.- The amount of time the home or business has been damaged or uninhabitable - If you have lived in a home for years and it suddenly sustains damage, the value of your loss may be much higher than if the home was new.- The amount of damage sustained - How much the home or business has been damaged will also impact the amount of the loss.- The condition of surrounding properties - If all of the properties in your area have experienced extensive damage, the value of your loss will be higher.- The amount of time it will take for repairs - The speed at which your insurance company will pay out your claim will also play an important role in determining the value of your loss.- The type of materials used to repair the damage - How the repairs are completed will also impact the value of your loss.- The amount of money that you have set aside in an emergency fund - This will help determine the amount of money that you can afford to spend on repairs.- The amount of money that you have saved up in preparation for potential repairs - This will help determine the amount of money you have available if repairs are needed.- The amount of money that you will spend on repairs if a claim is filed - This will help determine the amount of money that the insurance company will reimburse you for if you file a claim.- The amount of money that you will save if no claim is filed - This will help determine the amount of money that you will have leftover if no claim is filed.- The value of your home during its peak production years - This may be higher than the current value if it is out of production.- The value of your home during its off-season - This may be lower than the current value if it isn’t in production.- The value of your home during any significant time periods - This will help the adjuster determine when the damage occurred.- The value of your home during any significant time periods - This will help the adjuster determine when the damage occurred.- The amount of damage sustained by the home’s appliances - Appraisers will look at the value of your appliances and how much damage they have sustained.- The amount of damage sustained by the home’s appliances - Appraisers will look at the value of your appliances and how much damage they have sustained.- Whether the home or business has been in the same condition throughout the years - This will also impact the value of your loss.- Whether the home or business has been in the same condition throughout the years - This will also impact the value of your loss.- What the home or business would sell for if it were for sale - This will also impact the value of your loss.- What the home or business would sell for if it were for sale - This will also impact the value of your loss.- The value of comparable properties - This will help determine the value of your loss.- The value of comparable properties - This will help determine the value of your loss.- Anything else that may affect the value of your loss.- Anything else that may affect the value of your loss.- Anything else that may affect the value of your loss</p><h2 id="moreaboutthevalueofaloss">More about the value of a loss</h2><p>   The value of a loss is determined by the cost of repair and the amount your insurance company will pay out for that service. The valuation of your loss will also depend on the cost of materials, labor and any other expenses related to the repair. For example, if you need to replace your roof, the value of the loss would be the amount that it costs to replace it. If you are eligible for additional coverage for a specific type of repair, you may be able to have the rest of the damages paid for. When determining the value of your loss, it is important to keep in mind that the value is not what you think the property is worth, but rather what it would sell for if it were for sale.</p><h2 id="thebottomline">The bottom line</h2><p>   The bottom line is that a public insurance adjuster will be inspecting your home or business in preparation for filing a claim. They will look for numerous factors to determine the value of your loss so that the insurance company can settle the claim as quickly as possible. A public adjuster will be looking at the condition of the home, the amount of damage sustained, the amount of time it will take for repairs and the amount that you have set aside in an emergency fund.
