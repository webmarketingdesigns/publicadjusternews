                                                                                                    </h2>

                                                                                                    <p>A public adjuster (also called a special inspector, third-party inspector, or non-insured public adjuster) is a professional who helps individuals or businesses who have suffered damage from a disaster or catastrophe (such as a fire, flood, or storm) find resources to help them recover. The job of a public adjuster is to help you navigate the insurance claims process so that you get the best possible outcome from your insurance claim. An insurance adjuster works for an insurance company and has the same goal as you do – to get your home or business repaired and restored as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. But their job is to help the insurance company make the most money possible out of your claim, so it's not always in your best interests. If you don’t already have an insurance agent or broker on your team, we recommend reaching out to them as soon as possible so that they’re prepared for your claim. An experienced agent can help you navigate the claims process and may even be able to refer you to a public adjuster who can help with your claim and make certain that you get fair and timely compensation for your loss.</p><h2><a href='when-should-i-use-a-public-adjuster.html'>How to find a public adjuster</a></h2><p>If you don’t have insurance, or if your policy doesn't adequately cover the damage to your home or business, you can file a claim with your insurance company. But before you do, you'll need to hire a public adjuster to help you with the process. You can also do this if you’re renting a home that was damaged by fire, flood, or other insured event. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners recommends hiring a public adjuster within 60 days of the disaster. You can find a public adjuster by searching online, or you can contact the local office of your state's insurance department to get a list of reputable adjusters. The adjuster will help you prepare the claim, help you navigate the claims process with the insurance company, and collect all the information about your damage and its value so that they can file it with the insurance company. Once the claim has been approved, the insurance company will send a contractor to repair your home or business.</p><h2>How a public adjuster can help you receive more money</h2><p>When you hire a public adjuster, they may suggest that you hire a contractor to repair your home or business. A contractor will be able to repair your home or business more quickly and more efficiently than you can do it on your own. But they'll also charge you more to do so. And if you have an insurance claim, your insurance company will reimburse you for what your contractor charges you. That means you'll have to come up with the difference between what the contractor charges you and what the insurance company pays. But if you hire a public adjuster, they can help you find affordable contractors who will repair your home or business without charging you an excessive fee. If you hire a contractor to repair your home without help from a public adjuster, you'll have to pay the contractor's full contract price.</p><h2>How a public adjuster can help you get the repairs done faster</h2><p>If you hire a contractor to repair your home, they’ll be able to start the repairs as soon as they’re approved by the insurance company. But if you hire a public adjuster, they can help you get in touch with contractors who are willing to work on a quick turnaround. And if you're dealing with a flood or other natural disaster, a public adjuster can help you find contractors that are prepared to work in flood zones. If you have to make a claim, you'll have to provide a lot of information to the insurance company, including a detailed account of your loss, photographs of the damage, and a repair estimate. And if you hire a contractor to repair your home without help from a public adjuster, you’ll have to provide all that information to the contractor. You’ll also have to coordinate with the contractor to make sure that the repairs are completed correctly and in a timely manner.</p><h2>How a public adjuster can help you get approved for more repairs</h2><p>If your insurance company approves your claim and decides to repair your home or business, they’ll send a contractor to do the repairs. But if you hire a public adjuster, they can help you get the insurance company to approve more repairs than the insurance company originally approved. For example, if your roof was damaged by a storm, your insurance company might decide to repair it with a roofer that specializes in repairing old and worn roofing systems. But if you hire a public adjuster, they can help you get the insurance company to approve a roofer who can repair your roof using more modern and stronger materials. Similarly, if your home is damaged by a flood, the insurance company might decide to repair it using a contractor who specializes in flood-resistant building materials. But if you hire a public adjuster, they can help you get the insurance company to approve contractors who use materials that are more durable and better suited to the climate in which your home is located.</p><h2>How a public adjuster can help you get reimbursed for your travel expenses</h2><p>If your home or business was damaged by a storm, flood, or other covered event, the insurance company will cover your travel expenses as part of the settlement. But if you hire a public adjuster, they can help you get the insurance company to reimburse you for your travel expenses. If you have to travel a long distance to get to and from work, or if your home or business was damaged by a storm, flood, or other covered event, the insurance company might decide to reimburse you for your travel expenses. If you hire a public adjuster, they can help you get the insurance company to reimburse you for your travel expenses. Similarly, if your home or business was damaged by a storm, flood, or other covered event, the insurance company might decide to reimburse you for the costs of cleaning your home or business.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>When you hire a public adjuster to help you with your insurance claim, you have two potential benefits. First, you can increase the amount of money your insurer pays to repair your home or business, and second, you can get the repairs done faster and more efficiently. If you have suffered damage from a storm, flood, or other covered event, you might want to hire a public adjuster to help you navigate the claims process and get the best possible outcome from your insurance claim.</p>
