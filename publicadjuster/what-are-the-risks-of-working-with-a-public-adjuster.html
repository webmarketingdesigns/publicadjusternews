                                                                                                    <p>A public insurance adjuster is hired by an insurance company to help handle claims after a home or business has been damaged by a covered loss. A public adjuster may assist with everything from initial communications with the insured to finalizing repairs and getting the claim paid. The risk of working with a public adjuster is that the adjuster will prioritize what benefits them most — their own profit — rather than focusing on getting the claim resolved quickly and efficiently for the insured with an eye towards getting the claim paid quickly and fairly. In other words, there is the potential for public adjusters to focus more on collecting their own paycheck than helping you get what you’re owed. Before agreeing to work with any adjuster, it’s important to understand the potential downsides so that you can make an informed decision about whether they are a good fit for your needs. If you are insured by a company with a standard homeowner’s or business policy and your loss is covered by the policy, there is very little risk involved in hiring a public adjuster to help you navigate the claims process. However, if you have a special or “custom” policy, it’s important to understand the details of the policy to make sure the adjuster is working for you and not the insurance company.</p><h2><a href='how-do-public-adjusters-get-paid.html'>What to look for in a public adjuster</a></h2><p>First and foremost, you must make sure that the public adjuster is working for you and not the insurance company. This is a critical distinction, as the insurance adjuster’s primary goal is to pay out as little money as possible while the public adjuster’s goal is to get you the most money possible. The best way to ensure this is to have the adjuster sign a contract that spells out their scope of work and the amount of money they will be paid. You should also make sure that the adjuster is licensed and insured. If the adjuster is not a licensed public adjuster, they may not be able to assist you with the claims process from start to finish.</p><h2>Conflicting interests</h2><p>Public adjusters often work directly with the insurance company, so they may not have a clear understanding of how the claims process works. This means that they may not be able to assist you with documenting the loss and helping you file the claim with the insurance company. They may also not have access to the information that the insurance company has provided you with about how much your claim is worth. In this situation, the public adjuster may be more focused on collecting their own paycheck than helping you get the claim resolved quickly and efficiently.</p><h2>Low quality work and poor communication</h2><p>Public adjusters are hired by the insurance company, so they have no incentive to provide high-quality work and excellent communication. This can lead to a lower quality of service and a lack of transparency in the claims process. If you have a complicated claim that involves repairs or scientific testing, it’s important to find a public adjuster who has the experience and skills to handle your case. Unfortunately, this can be difficult because many public adjusters have a limited scope of work and do not handle complex claims.</p><h2>Discriminating against people of color or low-income households</h2><p>Public adjusters are hired by insurance companies, so they may be more likely to work with people who are more likely to have the resources to pay their claims. Historically, public adjusters have discriminated against people of color, low-income households, renters and others who are less likely to have the resources to pay out-of-pocket for their losses and more likely to need assistance with the claims process. This can include failing to respond to requests for service and failing to communicate effectively with the insured.</p><h2>Bias against certain types of damage</h2><p>Some types of damage are less common than others, and public adjusters may have a financial interest in not spending time on those types of claims. For example, a public adjuster may have a financial interest in not spending time on wind damage claims if they come from homes that are below sea level. They may also not have a financial interest in not spending time on hail damage claims if the insured has a “Hail Coverage Rider” on their policy.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Working with a public adjuster can be a positive experience, but it’s important to understand the risks associated with this type of work. Make sure that the adjuster is working for you and not the insurance company and that they are licensed and insured. It’s also important to understand the potential downsides of working with a public adjuster, such as conflicting interests, low quality work, discrimination against certain types of damage and more. After you’ve found a public adjuster and signed a contract, you can rest assured that they will be focused on helping you get the claim resolved quickly and efficiently for the insured with an eye towards getting the claim paid quickly and fairly.</p>
