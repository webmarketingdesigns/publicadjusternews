                                                                                                    <p>If you’ve ever seen a public adjuster in action, then there are probably a few misconceptions about what these professionals do. Some people believe that public adjusters are crooks who only want to rip people off. Others think that they are the same as real estate brokers because they both negotiate on behalf of others. Still others think that public adjusters are in cahoots with insurance companies, eager to pay as little as possible in settlements. In reality, public adjusters are not a monolithic group, but rather a diverse group of professionals who have specialized in the field of real estate. There are several myths surrounding public adjusters that need to be dispelled. This article will give you an overview of what a public adjuster actually does, the scope of their services and what types of clients they represent.</p><h2><a href='when-is-it-a-good-idea-to-hire-a-public-adjuster.html'>What is a public adjuster?</a></h2><p>A public adjuster is a real estate professional who specializes in representing people who have been denied insurance payments because their home was damaged in a natural disaster or because of faulty construction. A public adjuster may also represent owners of properties that have sustained significant damage from a fire or other types of loss but who have been denied coverage. In addition to helping people obtain a higher settlement amount from their insurer, a public adjuster may also be able to negotiate with insurance companies on the clients’ behalf to get the claim resolved more quickly.</p><h2>Myth: They only negotiate with insurance companies and not with victims.</h2><p>Some people believe that public adjusters are not independent contractors and have no direct contact with clients. The fact is that public adjusters must be licensed and insured, just like all other real estate professionals. In fact, public adjusters are heavily regulated by the state, just like other real estate professionals. While it is true that public adjusters are often hired by insurance companies to handle claims, many also work directly with people who need assistance with resolving their claims.Public adjusters also handle the business side of claims. They assist with all aspects of claims, from getting the claim started to negotiating settlements.</p><h2>Myth: They are just salespeople eager to push people into contracts.</h2><p>This is an interesting misconception, because many people assume that public adjusters must be sales people who push clients into buying coverage. In fact, many public adjusters are licensed real estate professionals who have specialized in this field of work for many years. They understand the importance of protecting clients against loss, and they know that taking out a large insurance policy on a new home can be risky. Public adjusters are not in the business of pushing their clients to purchase the most expensive policy. Instead, they help clients find the right coverage for their needs.</p><h2>Myth: They are connected with insurance companies and work together to pay as little as possible.</h2><p>As mentioned above, public adjusters are not in cahoots with insurance companies. If anything, they are independent contractors who are hired by insurance companies to handle claims. Public adjusters have the expertise to help clients resolve insurance disputes more quickly and efficiently. In fact, public adjusters often work with clients to help them avoid unnecessary legal proceedings. In some cases, public adjusters may be able to negotiate settlements directly with insurance companies, avoiding costly legal action.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>When it comes to natural disasters, fire, or other types of loss, the process of adjusting a claim can be complicated and stressful. That’s where public adjusters come in. They are highly trained professionals who specialize in resolving insurance claims, helping property owners access the funds they need. While the initial hiring process can be stressful, the benefits of working with a public adjuster will make up for it in the long run.
