                                                                                                    <p> A public adjuster is a person or company that helps property owners file damage claims and negotiate settlements with their insurers. The main advantage of using a public adjuster is that they have direct access to the insurance companies and have the legal knowledge and experience to navigate the claims process. The disadvantage is that they generally work for a percentage of the settlement amount instead of being paid an hourly fee. There are pros and cons to using a public adjuster, and this decision should be based on your individual situation and the type of claim (i.e. fire, flood, roof damage, etc.). It might also depend on how much time you have to spare. A general rule of thumb is that if you have time to read up on the basics and understand the claims process, then you don’t need a public adjuster. If you don’t have the time or energy to read complex legal documents and understand insurance terminology, then a public adjuster could be helpful. However, if you have the time and ability to do your own research, then it might not be worth the cost of hiring a public adjuster. There are also companies that specialize in negotiating with insurers on your behalf. If you have a trusted friend or family member who can help you navigate the claims process, then that might be the best option for you.</p><h2><a href='what-do-public-adjusters-do.html'>Should I hire a public adjuster for my fire damage claim?</a></h2><p>If you have suffered significant property damage from a fire, then you will likely file an insurance claim. However, before your insurer will pay out the claim, you will have to prove that it is legitimate and that the damage was caused by the fire. This is known as “proving damage.” In most fire insurance policies, the insurer will require an engineer to inspect the property to determine how much the fire has damaged it. The engineer will look at the type and severity of the fire damage and the cost to repair it. It is important that you hire a public adjuster as soon as possible after the fire to start the claims process. It can take a few weeks for the adjuster to get in touch with you and start the claims process. If you hire a public adjuster before you file the claim, then you will have more time to negotiate the settlement amount.</p><h2>Should I hire a public adjuster for my flood damage claim?</h2><p>If you have suffered significant property damage from a flood, then you will likely file an insurance claim.
